      "After obtaining several estimates to replace my roof, I decided to go with Matute Roofing who came highly recommended by a friend who had used them also. Peter was a pleasure to deal with and the project lead kept me well informed throughout the day of the roof replacement. Their team wound up replacing a skylight as well and the whole project was completed in one day; all debris cleared and cleaned up meticulously. I highly recommend Matute if you are in the market for a roof replacement.",
      "I highly recommend Matute for any roofing needs. They had a quick turnaround time, fair price, hardworking crew, quality work and clear communication. The team were able to replace my roof, gutters, downspouts, vents and skylight in one day. They were also able to reroute my 2 bathroom fans through the roof. They left the yard/house clean and ensured I was happy with the job before accepting payment.",
      "Had a great experience with Matute Roofing. Peter was super responsive and easy to work with the whole way through. They gave a fair estimate—no BS or tricks—and even notified me in advance about upcoming price increases. They were proactive about fixing a bit of siding damage and matched it perfectly. Paying was easy and they stuck to the original estimate. They also did a great job cleaning up debris from both my house and my neighbor’s. Highly recommend."

Throughout the day the roofing team kept me informed and even took some photos of the roof after each step. Home care takes some effort and this company assures things will go well.",

      "I had a great experience with Jersey Roofing. Greg was very helpful and detailed oriented. He was always following up with us and keeping us in the loop of the progress of the work being done with my roof...sending me pictures of what they found, what needed to be done, etc. Eric, in charge at the job site, was also fantastic. Like Greg he kept us informed. Alex was also great, walked us around the house at the end of the job and gave us a full detail of what was done. We had a lot of work that needed to be done. They removed one layer of cedar shakes, and two layers of shingles, replaced the plywood on the entire house and our garage. We love our new roof. Two days of work and on the third day, the gutters were installed. Awesome work! I recommend them highly!",
      "Exceptional Roofing Service & Outstanding Project Team! We can’t say enough great things about Jersey Roofing and our incredible sales rep Aleks. From start to finish, the entire process was smooth, professional, and stress-free. Aleks and their office manager Min went above and beyond to keep us informed, answer all our questions, and ensure everything was completed to the highest standard (not to mention at a very reasonable final cost as well). Our project manager Julio and his crew were efficient, courteous, and left the worksite spotless. The new roof looks amazing, and we couldn’t be happier with the quality of workmanship. Knowing we had such a dedicated and knowledgeable team overseeing everything gave us complete peace of mind. Highly recommend!",

The solar contractor was a sud to the Grapevine Pro contractor. So the customer only had to deal with the primary contractor , Grapevine Pro. I was very happy with the work done and the communication between myself and the project manager."

      "I couldn’t be happier with the recent driveway and stoop replacement done by this team. The craftsmanship is top-notch—everything from the smooth blacktop to the perfectly laid stone paver borders and beautiful stonework on the stoop was completed with incredible attention to detail. The new addition blends seamlessly with the overall look of the house and significantly boosts curb appeal. This isn’t the first time I’ve hired them—they previously did excellent work replacing my roof and installing new siding, which is why I trusted them again for this project. Just like before, they delivered outstanding quality, stayed on schedule, and left the site spotless. Highly recommend them for any exterior home improvement work—reliable, professional, and results that speak for themselves!",
      "I recently had the pleasure of working with Paul from Brothers Aluminum Siding for the installation of siding and a new stone porch for our home. From start to finish, the experience was seamless and professional. Paul was very easy to work with. Paul and his team demonstrated expertise and attention to detail. He took the time to understand my specific needs and provided valuable recommendations to enhance the overall look and durability of my home exterior. Paul kept me informed at every stage, and any questions were promptly addressed and the crew maintained a clean and organized worksite, which I greatly appreciated. I highly recommend Brothers Aluminum Siding.",
      "I called Chris from Brothers Aluminum when I was in the very premature stages of reaching out to contractors to redo our rotted-out front and back deck. It was an easy decision to go with Brothers Aluminum. He made himself available by phone and/or appointment when I had any questions or changes. He made the process very easy and comfortable that we actually did a lot more renovations than we originally intended. We intended to only redo our decks but ended up adding a basketball court in our yard, window in our dining room and redid the siding on our home. We were more than happy with the results! It looks like a completely different home. We've received so many compliments. Not only was the quality of the work amazing, but the workers (extremely hard workers) that would show up to my home each day were extremely friendly and respectful. I even called him recently to discuss further work!! :)"

      "Complete Roofing Systems replaced my flat roof in March of 2025, they also repaired some of my shingled portion of the roof and did repair on my chimney as well. Mike Stone at Complete Roofing Systems is a true professional and very trustworthy. Mike was extremely thorough and detailed with my estimate, but it was simple to understand. Mike was upfront about all the work needed to replace my roof, there were no surprises which was refreshing. Mike kept me updated on the start of my project after he received my initial deposit, I did not have to follow up with him for the status, he consistently kept me updated about the start date. The work was completed in one day and Mike personally came by at the start of my project even though Mike had assigned a project manager to be at my home during the replacement. The team at Complete Roofing was great, they did a great job and kept my property very clean during and after the process. I would recommend Mike Stone and Complete Roofing Systems to do work on your roof, chimney, or siding, they are very reliable and honest. I have recommended using Complete Roofing Systems to friends and trust that they will do a great job as they did for me. I will definitely use Complete Roofing Systems to do future work at my home.",
      "I have been an engineer for 30 years. I’m usually disappointed when dealing with contractors as I have collected a vast amount of knowledge and experience along the way. Most roofers are not trained or educated well. They don’t follow specifications or manufacturer guidelines. It’s kind of the Wild West. Mike Stone was probably the only roofer in my lifetime that I talked to that impressed me. Complete Roof Systems has designed different tiers of roofing packages that are specific to the job. This is brilliant as every house and structure are different as well as the situation. They have compiled installation techniques , various materials and levels of warranties that cannot be matched. I can’t believe I’m about to say this, but Mike Stone taught me a thing or two during our project. They are literally the Picasso of roofing. The project went flawlessly and my wife and I are very very happy thank you. Complete roof systems."

      "We recently had American Home Contractors complete multiple jobs at our home in East Hanover. We hired them for full siding and soffits, roof replacement, new windows, and a new front door. From start to finish, their professionalism and expertise were evident. The team arrived on time, worked efficiently, and completed the job on schedule. Communication was clear with the crew and they were friendly and organized. I highly recommend Jon & American Home Contractors for anyone looking to upgrade their siding, roof, or exterior. They did a great job & did a walk through at the end to ensure we were happy with the work.",
      "They are the BEST! I got several estimates for a new roof, but they were the only one that provided an extensive list of references. I knew exactly what I wanted/didn't want for specific reasons (even though it differed from what they would normally do) and Jon and his crew did exactly what I wanted perfectly. I have good familiarity as to the proper way to do things and they did things exactly as I expected in that regard. They were less expensive than the highest estimate (who would not do things as I wanted) and only slightly more (about $300) than the least expensive estimate but worth every cent of the difference. Moreover, while working, I could see that the crew identified, and properly fixed, a couple of problem issue spots on the roof that I didn't know I had - and I didn't get hit up with the typical \"well that gonna cost a bunch extra\" nonsense that some less honest contractors will raise - the guys just (properly) fixed things and moved on without a word to me! Jon gave me his cell number \"just in case any issue arose\" and, at one point when there was a seeming miscommunication between the crew and my understanding regarding needing attic access, I contacted him and he almost immediately responded and cleared things up. Finally, when they were done, the cleanup was exceptional. Again better than most contractors I have dealt with where you are finding scraps and remnants all over the place (including neighbors' yards). And anyone who has dealt with a roof replacement probably knows what I mean. In fact, as they were working, one guy was routinely walking around cleaning up things and making sure that stuff didn't go into any neighboring yard. I would not hesitate to recommend Jon and his crew at American Home Contractors to anyone needing roofing work - repair or replacement - they are true professionals!",
      "We contacted American Home contractor Chris back in Jan when I had some shingles in back of my roof blown off due to high winds. He was prompt to provide me with estimates explaining the issue. Jon - the owner stopped by next day to look at it and agreed with suggestion from insurance company the need for back half roof replacement. Due to winter time, I delayed the roof replacement and got roof fixed with local handyman. Fast forward, in March I had again similar damage to my roof - both in front and back of roof. This time I made the decision and contacted Chris and Jon requesting them to go ahead with my full roof replacement. Within few hours I got the estimates which was very reasonable and in line with what insurance company suggested would cost for replacement. Jon was very helpful in explaining what material to use to ensure I get the gold pledge warranty from GAF that I wanted to have. My roof replacement work started on 3rd business day after my phone call and was done within a day. EXTREMELY HAPPY AND SATISFIED. Chris explained me everyone what to expect on the day of roof replacement. The whole crew was professional, they covered house with tarp type cloth before starting work. Used the professional equipment so work gets finished within a day. Whole project was managed in a professional manner. I would definitely recommend them for anyone looking to do their roof replacement."

From the very beginning, Rob treated our home like it was his own, and it showed in every aspect of the project—from his craftsmanship to his professionalism and incredible attention to detail. Rob didn’t just do the job—he took pride in it. He was incredibly meticulous, carefully inspecting every element. If something seemed even slightly off, he addressed it without hesitation. The care he put into the roof penetrations, siding, and custom trim around the windows went well beyond our expectations. What stood out most was how responsive and thoughtful Rob was. He kept us informed, answered all our questions promptly, and made sure we always felt confident in the process. It wasn’t just about finishing the job—it was about doing it right for us. The work was completed on time, the pricing was more than fair, and the results were truly exceptional. We honestly wish Rob and his team could handle every project around our home—we wouldn’t hesitate to call them again. If you’re looking for someone who genuinely cares about their work and their clients, Hammer Exteriors is the clear five-star choice.",
      "From beginning to end the process of getting a new roof was made simple. The price was one of the lowest that I received, the materials used are top of the line and communication was perfect. The crew came and finished the job in half a day and cleaned up all materials. Very pleased and would recommend this company without hesitation."

      "We initially called Future Remodeling to evaluate the condition of the roof since it was growing mold in areas. Nick climbed through a window to inspect the garage roof. Nick and Estaban also checked in the attic crawl space to confirm existing insulation in the eves. Nick explained all the roof issues and we decided we needed a new roof. Nick and Estaban explained, using samples, of how they incorporate efficient and continuous ventilation within their roofing system and according to the GAF guidelines. It was easy signing the contract especially with the discounts. They reviewed the contract: every piece for the new roof, gutters and leaders were all documented. Tanner was our project manager and our contact from that point , establishing the datelines for the delivery, installation and any future questions. Tanner kept us up to date with any changes to the project. All Team members at Future Remodeling were very easy to talk and the installation crew was very efficient, professional and clean. They went above and beyond to make things right. I spoke to my neighbors, who's property is very close to my garage and they were very pleased with the way they protected her property."

His professionalism, expertise, and genuine care stood out right away. His right-hand man, Christopher Choi, was equally impressive, and together they guided us through the entire process, ensuring everything was tailored to the needs of our 102-year-old house. When it came to choosing windows, they provided the best options that perfectly suited our home. Even when the town’s building inspector unexpectedly halted progress and demanded a change in the siding material, Vinny quickly came up with a brilliant alternative that not only satisfied the requirements but also enhanced the overall project. The quality of their work exceeded our expectations, and their problem-solving skills and dedication were unparalleled. By far, this was the best contractor experience I’ve ever had.

He used software to calculate the exact amount of shingles we needed so we didn’t over order. When we couldn’t find the shingles we wanted for our cottage-style home locally due to supply chain issues, he ordered them from an out-of-state home improvement store and had them shipped to us. His crew worked hard every day until our large roof was done, and they took pride in their work. They were also tidy and professional. Art treats them well and it shows. They also installed new copper flashing on our home’s three chimneys and it came out really nice. We had a few leaks before installing the new roof, but now there are none!

Found the same family running the business with many of the same workers. We did get other quotes for comparison and their price was fair and competitive. They came when they said they would; did the job (house and garage) in two days; did a thorough job of cleaning all debris from our property and our neighbors’. They are friendly and just a great business to work with. I highly recommend them.",
      "R&G Roofing is the real deal. They came recommended by a list of about 8 of our neighbors - as THE roofing company to use to re-shingle our home in Maplewood. They also removed a non-functional skylight, sealing the opening on the outside and refinishing the ceiling on the inside. I swear you'd never even know it was ever there. Seamless repair work. The roofing team was incredible and the whole thing was done in just 2 days. They carefully minded our landscaping, bushes and flowers and cleaned up exceptionally well. I highly recommend R&G Roofing. You won't be sorry if you use them.",
      "R and G did an excellent job replacing our roof and gutters. We have an old house with built-in gutters and a Victorian roofline -- dormer, towers, etc. The gutters were rotting, making everything a bit more complicated -- R and G did a fantastic job replacing them. Marcos and his team were great, highly recommend."

The quoted price was 100% accurate and the house looks fantastic. It is clear they pay attention to detail and take pride in their work.

They took the time to answer all my questions and made sure I felt comfortable every step of the way. I highly recommend Carpenters Touch to anyone looking for quality work and excellent service!",
      "We were interested in giving our 70 year old home some updated curb appeal when we decided this will be our 'forever home'. I contacted three contractors who specialized in James Hardie siding installations after researching about that premium product, including a local contractor who I had used before. We had a design and color scheme in mind and met with our salesman, Luke, who gave use more possibilities we had not considered or been aware of. When we received the estimate, it was considerably lower than any other written estimate we received for the same scope of work. Additionally, I just felt very comfortable with the people from Carpenters Touch as they explained we could easily add more options as the job progressed. The end result is that we have a brand new exterior that is weatherproof, insulated and cozy throughout the entire living space. I have received many compliments on the attention to detail and extra effort that you do not normally see in an exterior renovation project. The workers were always prompt, courteous and cleaned up at end of each workday, and gave their best effort consistently. I would highly recommend this firm, they went above and beyond our expectations."

      "B&W Group did an outstanding job replacing our roof. It was a big job as the roof had the original wooden shingles plus 2-3 layers of additional shingles. The owner/manager, Ziggy, was a pleasure to work with throughout. He came to the house very quickly after reaching out to B&W to inspect a leak, tarp the leak and measure the house to provide a roof replacement estimate. During the project, the group worked very hard from early in the morning until sundown putting together a final product that we are extremely pleased with. June 2024 Update: We are amending our review to 3/5 given that there has been an ongoing issue with the roof near the chimney. B&W attended to this issue a few times without success. Recently, upon water testing the area to pinpoint the problem and confirming there was roof flashing leaks, B&W ceased responding to our messages. This included both text messages and voicemail. This is highly disappointing given the warranty on the roof.",
      "Ziggy and his team were an absolute pleasure to work with. They are absolutely professional and very well organized. I can highly recommend if you are looking for roofers. Ziggy checked in with me during all phases of the project and made sure that the work was done properly. The team was very efficient and got the job done in 2 days. They did a fantastic job and were very mindful. Thank you!",

      "We were very impressed with B&B’s responsiveness, work quality and attention to detail. Our house required both roof and siding work to meet a homeowners’ insurance assessment, and B&B’s work met the requirements and then some. Their team was also sensitive to the needs of my elderly parents while getting the work done. Highly recommended.",
      "Would definitely NOT RECOMMEND this company for multiple reasons. First is that a few years back we had done a house and was given a quote. Given all the positive reviews we decided to go against getting other quotes. Big mistake. First there was a delay because they didn’t get all of their equipment on site due to miscommunication amongst themselves. Secondly when they got their equipment on site, they realized they did not need it. That delayed the start of the job by a couple of days. When they finally started the work, they decided that we didn’t need the insulation and decided to take it away DESPITE that we paid for it. No disclosure about that. Only reason how we found out was because a family member that lived nearby saw the job and alerted us. They had to take down all of the siding already gone up to install the insulation. I decided to inspect the work randomly at night after the guys left and found on multiple occasions the siding nails were anchored into nothing. You could easily pull off the siding on certain parts. Had to show the lead person there each time. Note that I NEVER saw Kamil on site once. Not happy with the experience but wanted to give them a second chance. Big mistake again. Had them come out to price out a new roof. Gave me a quote but then tried to nickel and dime me for everything. Found out only after I got a second quote from a different roofer who gave me a better price with everything included. It was also the second roofer that saw the materials that Kamil’s team dropped off that said they were not using the right materials and if they installed the GAF shingles with roofing paper instead of the synthetic membrane required by GAF to get the 50 year warranty, the warranty was voided. This company also doesn’t have integrity. Because their name is so similar to another company, B&B Roofing and Contracting, often times potential customer would call this company by accident. But instead of saying that they’re calling the wrong place, they would misrepresent themselves as the other company to poach customers. Only reason why I’m writing this review a few years down the line is because I’m looking to do the siding of another house and this company came up as one of the top companies, and I just do not believe in the quality of their work. YMMV. Not saying they haven’t done good work for others. My experience has just been negative.",
      "I will definitely recommended B&B Siding and Roofing for they did an amazing job on my 2 homes. Their prices are unbeatable for the quality work done & Excellent Customer Service. Jason, Alex & Laura have been a pleasure to work with. Definitely looking forward to continue to do business with them.

      "We had our roof done by Seci Construction. MANDI came for our initial appointment and explained to us everything in details what needed to be done. MANDI was very professional and very knowledgeable. The day of install i could not be more happy with the vision MANDI had to match the roof color with my siding and everything around. I will recommend Seci without a doubt. Thank you MANDI and Seci Construction.",
      "Let me just say Seci Construction is a class act from start to finish! I had my 2,500 Sq Ft roof replaced by them and from start to finish the job was perfect. This company offers extremely fair pricing based on other estimates I received. They were actually about 1/2 the price of other local Angi rated companies I met with like Victory Home Remodeling, Power Home Remodeling, Matute Roofong etc.. They showed me samples of both Owens Corning & GAF shingles, (only company I met with who did this) & explained the differences between the two. I ended up choosing Owens Corning because in my opinion they had a better shingle color option that fit the design of my house perfectly but Seci is able to offer a 50 Year Warranty on both shingle manufacturers so it didn’t really make a difference over what I choose. Before I choose Seci I did my research and saw some iffy reviews about the plywood that I was alittle worried about before I signed the contract with them. Once the roof was ripped off I DID NOT experience anything close to what these reviews said when it came to the plywood part of the project. Cobra who was my project manager explained what wood could be saved & what he recommended should be replaced. He even gave me pricing options on the different types/thicknesses of plywood is out there. Overall I felt the price was fair when you factor in the market rate of plywood plus labor for removing the old and installing the new. Regardless Seci Construction is a great option if you are looking for a seamless experience without breaking the bank. I will definitely be recommending them to my friends & family and I look forward to working with them again in the future when I replace my siding & windows. Thank you again Seci!",
      "I recently had my roof replaced by SECI Construction Inc., and I couldn’t be happier with the experience. Edi and his team were incredibly professional throughout the entire process. We had been dealing with multiple issues with our roof for a while, but SECI Construction quickly identified the problems and offered us a fantastic price for a full replacement. The quality of their work exceeded our expectations, and we’re so glad we chose SECI Construction instead of another contractor. I highly recommend them to anyone in need of roofing services. Excellent job all around!"

      "Needed a 4x4 section = 20ft of vinyl siding repaired/ replaced in Yonkers. I was quoted $2000 dollars, pretty much $100 a foot for vinyl siding and install. That being said they wanted 1500$ before starting the work. Never pay anyone beofer they do work, especially for $200 if that of material. I emailed them and let them know I was quoted by several other companies as I always do now with repair quotes and they were nearly triple the price. I figured a local business would give a fair price to a local homeowner. WRONG Their answer was thanks for the feedback. Over the years I've learned beware of these business that overcharge small home owners, instead they want to take all your money. Thanks for nothing",

      "After a lot of checking, this was the only roofer I found that had a special crew that specializes in flat roof work. They were very knowledgeable and very professional. Jon, a sales rep and one of the work managers, impressed me with his honesty when he told me, unlike other roofers I spoke with, that in my case -- since there was no bubbling on the old asphalt roofing -- there would be little benefit in tearing out the old roofing as opposed to just adding a replacement on top, except that tearing out the old would cost a few hundred dollars more. Also, others quoted me a price just for slapping new asphalt on top of or in place of the old asphalt, whereas Big Apple -- for almost the same price -- did a 3-part job of first installing a layered system of roof paving to direct rainwater toward the drains, then adding a synthetic water proofing material on top of the paving, and finally installing the asphalt roofing. They also have a crew, I understand, that specializes in shingle roofing. In short, a top-quality roofing company I would definitely use again, and would highly recommend for their honesty, competitive pricing, and conscientious professionalism.",

      "I met Johnny when I was pulling into my Mom’s driveway. He was going door to door in her neighborhood. My Mom wasn’t ready for any home improvements, but I told Johnny we were looking to get prices for a roof and possible siding. Johnny was extremely pleasant and was able set up an appointment for 2 days later. The morning of our appointment we received a call from Jonathan to confirm our time and to make sure we were still good with the time. Jonathan was also very kind. The salesperson Cam showed up at scheduled time. We liked his personality immediately. Cam took his time explaining Victory’s procedures, process and products during his time here. Cam explained and showed us each layer and how they installed the roof and siding. He then measured, checked attic, and siding for any water damage ect. We then discussed cost. We decided to do just do it all. This was our only estimate, although higher than expected we felt confident that this was a great company with top notch materials that is warrantied for 50 years. Stay tuned for future results. Meeting with project manager next week to go over everything again and set up dates. Thank you Johnny, Jonathan, and Cam for your professionalism and kindness. Update: Project manager Anthony and Augie stopped buy and after looking over the finished project we decided to add new gutters now. The crew for roof and siding were amazing! Clean up was great. They went above and beyond to make us happy. Never met a nicer group.",

Rating: 1/5 stars I'm extremely disappointed and feel taken advantage of by Kamtech Solar. Back in May, I researched several companies for solar panel roof installation and chose Kamtech based on my conversations with their representative, Michael V. Initially, I thought I'd made a great choice, but that optimism was short-lived. The installation was completed in August, but when I had it inspected, it failed. I made multiple calls to address the issue, and Kamtech finally returned to correct the electrical work that was done incorrectly. However, their handyman made matters worse, leaving additional holes in my home. Since then, I've tried to contact my rep, Michael V, multiple times via phone calls and texts, but my messages have been ignored. It seems like I've been duped, and I would strongly advise against using Kamtech Solar. The lack of accountability and poor workmanship is unacceptable. I hope others can learn from my experience and choose a more reputable company for their solar needs."

They keep blaming other parties for the hold up, like the utility company, but it's them that can't get things done.

From the initial quote and all throughout the entire process, Jason, Sulaiman and the rest of the team were there to answer every question and walk me through every step. If you called any of them they answered their phones happy to help. They worked with my budget and insurance company to make the process as easy as possible and the work was outstanding. They even made some repairs that were not in the project quote at no cost just to make sure everything came out perfect - which it did. I HIGHLY recommend Smart Roof and their team if you are in the market for new roof or repairing a roof. More than confident to recommend Smart Roof!"

We'll here we are 25 years later, and as the saying goes,\" fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice and the shame belongs to me!\" Bill G was very patient and helpful selecting the color. He provided numerous locations of work they had done of the colors we were considering. He also brought 4 full shingles in each color so we could see the actual look. Our roof is fairly large and I wanted it completed in one day. Most of the other estimates I received promised to be completed in two - three days. At 8AM both Bill G & George G Arrived with 14 men.

Their workers were professional, respectful and highly skilled, while the project manager ran the job with great attention to detail and was politely receptive to my many questions … collectively this produced a beautiful new roof completed in only four days and with minimal inconvenience. Upon receiving estimates from five companies, we found Abraham to be price competitive … however most importantly they proved to be compassionate and understanding to work with. When we had to delay our project by six months due to unfortunate family circumstances, they honored their initial quote and accommodated our request to still wait another month plus before starting the job … never was there any sales pressure, only patience to address our questions and satisfy our needs.

The owner, Jeff, stopped by to review the work as well. They guys were very clean, covering the bushes and picking up every piece of scrap.

Any request my husband and I had, he would accommodate without any hesitation or problems. Very professional and responsible company. We got 5 quotes and decided to go with Classic. The job was completed in a timely manner and the attention to detail was outstanding. For reference we only did the siding and garage door. Pictures below for reference.",
      "Classic Remodeling just replaced our roof on our house and garage and we couldn’t be happier. Keith gave us a quote after thoroughly going over our options. We paid exactly what the quote said. No up charges, no surprises. Their crew was professional, polite, and very hard working. They were amazingly fast and efficient. I would recommend them to anyone and already have."

      "First! Big shutout to Omar and his team. This is by far the best contractor we’ve hired. Mr. Omar is the business owner and he is also a hands on person. Omar not only foresee the whole siding installation. He also got on the ladder himself nailing panels. These great hardworking people would get up early and make it to your house before 8. They want to make sure to get an early start on the job. Very very respectful towards them. Siding job can be tricky. Mr. Omar only tells the truth. He is the finest man out there if you wish to get a new siding, new roof, new window. The craftsmanship is incredible. They don’t rush just to deliver. They take every step they need to ensure your property is being taken care of. This is the ONLY guy I will go with for our company wise properties. We just hired him for our primary home and the results are perfect! Recommended!!",
      "Omar and his guys did a fantastic job with the siding around our home. He did great communicating the process and pointing out the details of his work. Highly recommend if your looking to get siding done.",
      "Omar [Premium Home Improvements] did new roof, covered gutter and new sidings for our house in Berkeley Heights in September-October 2024; we like Omar’s work and we highly recommend Premium Home Improvements. a) Omar and his team (usually 5-6 persons) worked very hard, and they did their work very well and carefully. Omar chose the good GAF roofing materials and we even received a warranty from GAF. Omar made good suggestions on our attic fan and retrofitted the soffits for improved attic insulation. Omar also replaced several damaged plywood on our roof; their replacement will be good for our house in the long term. Omar was always present at the job. We estimated that Omar and his team spent 245 person-hour on roofing/gutters plus 365 person-hours on sidings. b) We also like Maguel in Omar’s team and Maguel did excellent work in installing our backyard storm door and replacing damaged window screens. At Omar’s suggestion, we hired Eric Berg [High Line Electric] to re-do doorbells and motion-detection outside-lights after installing new sidings; and we recommend Eric who is rather knowledgeable in his field. c) Omar hired a dumpster and portable toilet during work and Omar's team was very diligent in removing debris and nails from our yard and driveway and we appreciate their dedication. d) Omar was very responsive to our phone and text inquiries and nearly always replied within an hour. Omar kept his work schedule as promised. Omar made useful suggestions on materials quality and aesthetic perspectives. Omar and Marianela (Omar’s wife) are friendly, and they work well as a team since Marianela ordered materials and monitored weather forecast. We had friendly chats with Omar and Marianela on family, school and neighborhood since we are both long-time residents in Berkeley Heights. e) We chose Omar based mainly on my neighbor’s recommendation and we did not do any serious “shopping”. After we shared notes with other neighbors and found that Omar’s price was rather reasonable compared with the recent similar work in our neighborhood. I highly recommend Omar and his company [Premium Home Improvements]."

      "I have been reaching out about an unfinished project led by an employee named Terrence. I have been sending the emails to info@roofingbyinfinity.com. Please respond. No one ever responded to the email but ai finally spoke to someone....I will be updating my attempt at resolving the issue of being misinformed and lied to here frequently. Unfortunately I have been dealing with my mother's cancer so I have not been able to follow up on the problem like I would have liked but being patient with this company in the hopes that they would do the right thing has not accomplished anything for me. Additionally my brand new roof has a leak. I was hoping I would get better service after talking to one of the owners to make sure he was aware not only of the leak but the shady practices of their salesman Terrence but the owner actually demonstrated some of his employees' poor practices....promised he would call me back after I emailed him all the information regarding the issue but never did. This makes me wonder if he was the one that taught Terrence that it was ok to lie to customers. I will be back to update this post as I navigate the complaint process with consumer affairs and the better business bureau but please be on the look out for Terrance's tricks. Don't let him get you like I let him get me. Peace and Blessings.",

      "Excellent, highly recommend Infinity Roofing. The project manager, Edwin Reyes was fabulous starting with a clear discussion of drone photos of our roof to how Infinity would go about replacing it and what materials would be used. Supplies delivered as scheduled and the @3700sf roof was completed in 2 long days. The roofers were polite and efficient and all of external house was well protected. When they left, everything was clean and looked better than before. Mr. Reyes was available throughout and showed us final drone pics of completed project. Excellent experience, recommend highly."

I went on google and came across A1- Affordable . I saw mixed reviews but decided to give them a chance . I called the 1800 number and sheenah answered . I explained my situation and booked an appointment. The next day a technician was sent out to assess the situation and after an hour Steven came in , showed me pictures and gave me some recommendations. After getting 3 quotes my husband and I decided to go with A1 to restore our living room fire place . Within 24 hours Steven had a work crew led by Aurelio . The first day they performed a PCR and removed all the creosote from my 1966 fireplace . After 72 hours they came back out and restored my fireplace with a product called thermal crete . A week later I’m burning my fireplace with no smoke back . Thank you so much A1 …..",

I called local chimney companies around the Pottstown areas , and got no answer . My neighbor came across the street and asked what’s going on , thanks Tim !!! I explained everything to him and he recommended to call A1-Affordable that did multiple services at his home . I called A1 and Jessica picked up the phone . She listened to my concerns and said I’ll have a tech there within the hour . These guys arrived in less than an hour , assessed the situation and explained to me what was going on . I agreed to get the work done and they did the job within 2 hour. My heating chimney collapsed and led to carbon monoxide entering my home . Technician Krish, or Chris , too much going on at the time and Fresnal , immediately started to work on unblocking the chimney and guided me through the whole experience. 2 hours later everything was completed and I was able to bring my tenants and family back into the house . Thanks A1-Affordable. Thanks to your amazing techs ….. we will be calling for the other repairs in the summer ."
